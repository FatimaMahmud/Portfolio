   <Td width = 50%>We would love to hear from you. If you are interested in my work and if my skills could come in handy for you people, please read this page first before contacting us. The main objective of your contact page is to get your visitor in touch with you easily. Since the reader has already made a decision to contact you, your contact page should facilitate an easy and painless process of allowing them to reach you. You don’t have to convince them again about how great you are – this would gradually get redundant and annoying. This is the page that the rest of your site works hard to make visitors land on.</Td>
