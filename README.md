# Portfolio
Lab task 1

DOCUMENTATION:
	My portfolio contains 4 HTML pages i.e.
-	Home
  Page that tells about my skills, experience, education and interests
-	About Me
  Page that tells about my current life, my aims and what i have achieved in my life so far
-	Contact Me
  Page to let you know my contact infos
-	Gallery
  my work

What used:
Since I wasnâ€™t pro in HTML5 so I have used simple HTML to design a portfolio. I have used very common styles in it to change the font and color of the tabs i.e. (Home, Gallery, About, Contact). 

What I learned in this task

1-	How to link pages i.e. <a href> 
2-	How to refer to a style sheet using <link> tag
3-	Got a better understanding of the <div> tag i.e. how do we define classes and what advantage do we get using them
